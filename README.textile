The project in this repo demonstrates a potential bug in the "CSS Selector Binding":css-binding feature of "Lift 2.2":lift-2.2.

[lift-2.2]http://liftweb.net/22_final

Starting with the "lift_basic":lift-basic template provided in the Lift 2.2 sbt Zip, a <code>collectThemAll</code> method was added to the <code> "HelloWorld":hello-world </code> snippet. According to the "*Binding to children*":binding-to-kids section of the _Binding via CSS Selectors_ Assembla page, this method should make three copies of the element with an <code>id="token"</code> attribute and replace the content of each element with the strings in the <code>List("foo", "bar", "baz")</code>.

If you start up the application with <code>./sbt jetty</code> and direct your browser to "localhost:8080":localhost, you will see three links in the menu, "div":div, "span":span, and "ul":ul. Each page invokes the <code>collectThemAll</code> method in the <code> "HelloWorld":hello-world </code> snippet and binds it to the same element:

<pre><code><li id="token">Uh-oh!</li></code></pre>

[localhost]http://localhost:8080
[div]http://localhost:8080/div
[span]http://localhost:8080/span
[ul]http://localhost:8080/ul

The only difference between the pages is the parent tag of the <code><li></code> tag. When the parent tag is a <code><div></code> or a <code><ul></code>, the page renders correctly, as a unordered list:

* foo
* bar
* baz

When the parent is a <code><span></code> tag, however, the binding fails and renders this:

* Uh-oh!

Obviously, a <code><li></code> tag inside a <code><span></code> is not proper HTML, but it's surprising that the binding fails silently in this way.
